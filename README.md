# Pinball
Code for my ARDUINO Pinball
This solution is provided to display a backglass similar that found on the 1970's GOTTLIEB pinballs. All the  source is enclosed
you will need to find a good png of the backglass for your machine and work out where the scor reel would be. 
NOTE this is for a single score machine but will will be updated to include 2 score reels when i complete my GOTTLIEB
DUOTRON conversion to an ARDUINO and Processing P3 solution.
